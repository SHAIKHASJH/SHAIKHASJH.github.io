        <h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>
        <p>During my studies at Nottingham Trent University, I have come to understand the importance of professional behaviour in boosting my academic performance and preparing me for a future in the tech industry. Here are the key elements of professional conduct I have followed and areas I aim to improve:</p>
        
        <h2>Commitment to Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>As a student at NTU, professionalism starts with a firm adherence to academic integrity. This means engaging in all coursework and projects ethically, avoiding any form of plagiarism, and always accurately citing sources. I place a great emphasis on ensuring that my work is both original and properly credited, valuing honesty and integrity above all in my academic endeavours.</p>
        
        <h2>Developing Communication Skills</h2>
        <p>Effective communication is important when working with classmates, instructors, and potential employers, as well as in expressing ideas and explaining complex technical subjects. I have been actively improving my communication skills through participation in technical writing tasks, lectures, and group discussions. I have learned that clarity and professionalism are crucial in all forms of communication, whether it is oral or written.</p>
        
        <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhancing Time Management: Good time management is more than just keeping a well-planned schedule; it is about improving productivity, and personal well-being. I recognize that I need to better allocate my time and strategize to maximize efficiency, which will enhance my academic success and I will enjoy the journey while progressing towards the destination!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Reflecting on these experiences has helped maintain my commitment to these professional standards and highlighted areas where I can further develop to achieve my academic and career objectives.</p>
