            <h2>My Career Aspiration</h2>
            <p>As a cybersecurity professional, I aspire to become a computer and network security engineer. My goal is to design secure network solutions, conduct systematic security tests, and respond swiftly to security incidents.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="skills" class="skill-section">
            <h2>Essential Knowledge and Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> HTML, CSS, Operating Systems, Programming (Python, Java, C++), Network Skills, Cryptography</li>
                <li><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Problem-solving, Attention to Detail, Communication</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="analysis-section">
            <h3>Analysis and Evidence of My Own Skills</h3>
            <p>I have learned HTML and CSS recently and for this assessment, I am using my own template for the website. This helps me apply my learned skills to test.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on my current skill set in relation to my career aspirations in computer and network security, I have realized where my strengths lie and identified areas that need further development.</p>
            <h3>Current Skill Level</h3>
            <p>I have a strong grasp of the theoretical aspects of computer and network security, thanks to my coursework at Nottingham Trent University and my personal curiosity about reading blogs and medium articles. The modules I have taken so far have provided me with a solid foundation in understanding how networks operate, the basics of cryptography, and the principles behind secure system design.</p>
            <h3>Practical Skills</h3>
            <p>While I have engaged in some workshops and lab sessions, these have only given me a basic exposure to hands-on practices in cybersecurity. For instance, in a recent online workshop, I participated in a simulated network security exercise which helped me understand the real-world applications of the theories I have learned. This experience was invaluable, but it also highlighted how much more I need to practice to gain proficiency.</p>
            <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
            <p>Recognizing my need for more practical experience, I plan to seek additional workshops and hands-on training opportunities. Engaging in internships or part-time work related to network security could also be extremely beneficial. These experiences would enhance my practical skills and deepen my understanding of the security challenges and solutions in a real-world context.</p>
