            <h2 class="section-title">Reflection on Career Aspirations and Required Skills</h2>
            <p>As a first-year engineering student at Nottingham Trent University, I am setting my sights on a career that is exciting and particularly of my interest - computer and network security. With the digital world growing and evolving daily, the need for skilled professionals to safeguard digital infrastructures and sensitive data is more than ever.</p>
            <p>I aspire to become a computer and network security engineer. This role is important as it involves designing secure network solutions to guard against various cyber threats, conducting systematic tests to ensure systems are secure, and responding swiftly to security incidents.</p>
            <h3>Essential Knowledge and Skills for a Security Engineer</h3>
            <ul class="skill-list">
                <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Understanding of Operating Systems, Programming (Python, Java, C++), Network Skills, Cryptography</li>
                <li><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Problem-solving, Attention to Detail, Communication</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To build these skills, I plan to utilize online learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning, which offer a range of courses from cybersecurity basics to advanced network security and ethical hacking. Engaging with peers through forums such as Stack Overflow and cybersecurity communities on platforms like Discord and Reddit is also something I have considered that can be game-changing in my learning and professional growth.</p>
